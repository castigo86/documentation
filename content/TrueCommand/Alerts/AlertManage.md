TrueCommand alerts provide visual warnings for monitored systems that require attention.
Alerts are either generated by the monitored system or an alert rule created in TrueCommand.

## Viewing All Alerts

To see all alerts that TrueCommand has discovered, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **All Alerts**.
Administrator accounts can see all generated alerts.
A non-administrator account can only view alerts according to their team and user account permissions.

![AlertNoticesActiveAlerts](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/AlertNoticesActiveAlerts.png "Active Alerts")

The **Active Alerts** tab shows all unresolved alerts.
Alerts are moved to the **Resolved Alerts** tab by clicking *Resolve* Selected <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Check">check</i>.
To resolve multiple alerts, select each alert and click *Resolve* Selected<i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Check">check</i>.

Click *View alert notice details (`i`)* to view any user comments about an alert.

Administrator accounts can delete an alert by clicking *Delete* Selected<i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Delete">delete</i>.
Deleting an alert cannot be undone.
To delete multiple alerts, select each alert and click *Delete* Selected<i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Delete">delete</i>.

### Viewing Alerts by System

Alerts generated by a monitored system display in both the administrative **Systems** screen and the **Dashboard** as a number above the system icon.
To view all alerts for a single system, go to the **Dashboard** and select a single system.

![DashboardSystemAlerts](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/DashboardSystemAlerts.png "Dashboard: System Alerts")

Each active and resolved alert for that system is visible in this tab.
Clicking *View alert notice details (`i`)* shows details for that alert, including the option to leave comments about the alert.

## Managing Alert Rules

Alert rules generate alerts in TrueCommand.
TrueCommand has several default rules built in.
TrueCommand administrators and [team members]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/TCGettingStarted/UserAccounts.md" >}}) with the appropriate permissions can create new alert rules.

To view all TrueCommand alert rules, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Alert Rules**.

![AlertRules](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/AlertRules.png "Alert Rules")

Details about each TrueCommand alert rule are shown on this page, including which user account created the rule.
Users can activate, suspend, edit, or delete alert rules using either an administrator account, or the account that created the rule.

Users can create new TrueCommand alert rules to monitor a wide variety of system information and generate a TrueCommand alert if specific conditions occur.
To create a new alert rule, click *+ NEW ALERT RULE* and follow the creation wizard:

![AlertRulesCreate](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/AlertRulesCreate.png "Create new Alert Rule")

* Select a System: The rule will apply to these systems.
  Appropriate system permissions are required for non-administrative user accounts.
* Select a Data Source: Choose a data source for the rule.
  This is the type of information that can trigger an alert.
  For example, choosing *cpu_temp* means the alert rule monitors the temperature of the chosen system.
* Type and Threshold: Create the rule conditions:
  * Data type: This is the specific data TrueCommand will monitor.
    The options change depending on the **Data Source**.
  * Priority level: Choose *Information*, *Warning*, or *Critical*.
    This determines the category of alerts generated by this rule.
  * Comparison type: A conditional statement that applies to the **Data type** and the **Comparison value**.
  * Comparison value: Enter a value appropriate to the options scenario and options selected.
    This can act as a threshold or limitation on when an alert is generated by the rule.
* Finished: To create the new alert rule, click **CREATE ALERT**. To start over, click **RESET**.

## Configuring Alert Services

{{< hint info >}}
Configurable Alert Services are only available for local installations or containerized TrueCommand deployments.
TrueCommand Cloud instances are preconfigured to use email alerts; PagerDuty is not an option.
{{< /hint >}}

TrueCommand uses different services to expand how alerts are communicated to individual users or administrators.
Individual user accounts can use these services to manage how that account is notified of an alert.
To configure an alert service plugin, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Alert Services**.

![Alert Services](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/AlertServices.png "Alert Services")

Each plugin has three options.

<mat-icon _ngcontent-ath-c575="" role="img" fontset="mdi" fonticon="mdi-test-tube" class="mat-icon notranslate mdi mdi-test-tube mat-icon-no-color" aria-hidden="true" ng-reflect-font-set="mdi" ng-reflect-font-icon="mdi-test-tube"></mat-icon> : Sent Test Alert

<i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> : Configure Plugin

<mat-icon _ngcontent-ath-c200="" role="img" class="mat-icon notranslate material-icons mat-icon-no-color" aria-hidden="true">remove_circle</mat-icon> : Clear Plugin Configuration

Before proceding, verify that the sending mailserver has TLS enabled.  
TrueCommand cannot send emails through a mailserver without TLS.
{{< hint info >}}
An email address must exist on the users profile page to recieve emails.
{{< /hint >}}

Enter the mailserver and port along with the user and password for the email account to be used.
The *From* field allows you to customize the sender field of the email.
For a *No-Auth* SMTP configuration, leave the password field blank.

![AlertServicesSMTPEmailptions](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/AlertServicesSMTPEmailptions.png "Alert Services: SMTP Email options")

Click **Test** to verify that the configuarion is correct.
If you did not receive a test alert email, check the values entered for accuracy.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "PagerDuty" >}}

Open the **Configure Plugin** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> for PagerDuty.  In the
*Authtoken* section, enter your **Service Integration Key from PagerDuty**.  If you have an active subscription with PagerDuty, this key should be available to you. 
Enter a *Title for incident reports* if desired. Click *TEST*.

![AlertServicesPagerDutyOptions](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/AlertServicesPagerDutyOptions.png "Alert Services: Pager Duty options")

Login to your PagerDuty account and check for open incidents.
There you should see the triggered test alert from TrueCommand.
If you did not receive a test alert, check the **Service Integration Key from PagerDuty** for accuracy in the plugin configuration section of the alert service.
